# Overview

The mintboard is a community culture canvas, where users can post memes, artwork, lore, and videos onchain. When posts are minted, rewards are split between the creator and the community treasury. On each mint, rewards are split accordingly

**Creator reward** —> 0.000333 ETH 

**Space treasury reward** —> 0.000111 ETH 

**Mint referral reward** —> 0.000111 ETH 

**First minter reward** —> 0.000111 ETH

Mint referrals reward individual users with a small amount of eth whenever someone mints a post that is shared with a users unique url. Posts shared on warpcast render as frames and can be minted in-app with warps.
